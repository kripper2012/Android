# Android
I've created a simple viewpager.
It works fine but i'm trying to figure our how to achieve the following:
1. Instead of having 3 different tabs of people I want them all in one tab where I can scroll down thru the results. Am I able to use a recycler view for this and if so how?
2. So my information is pulling back just people info, say I want to also pull back vehicle information. I would need to create a service and an adapter and also a vehiclefragment to display the info?

Any help would be appreciated.
Thx
